## Appearances Matter

I've always been pretty utilitarian with my workspaces and never took much time customizing things. I'd change the wallpaper, mess with some font scaling and icon sizes and call it a day. What do I care, it's a tool and I wouldn't paint my hammer. Well, now I might.

Over a few decades of staring at terrible color and app UI's that look like they were built in 1998 I've started to take a little more time setting things up. 

### Desktop Environment

I've settled on [Pop_OS!](https://pop.system76.com/) with GNOME for a DE. I happen to like GNOME. I understand it and it enforces a separation of concerns that appeals to me along with offering just enough customization. I'm pretty minimalist anyway.

And when I say minimalist, I mean minimalist. No desktop icons, no visible panels or docks, clocks, geegaws or widgets. I use a couple of GNOME extensions to only display the top [bar](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/545/hide-top-bar/) on hover. I use [Dash to Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/) and it's hidden by default and revealed on hover (I like it on the left with small icons). I rarely use either and find the Super key easier for app launching or an overview.

## Code Editor

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) all day every day. I'll never have the need for Vim or Emacs and don't really want to learn a whole new OS. I've used and bought [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and as much as I like the speed and elegance of Sublime the pace of development just isn't there.

I don't do much fancy with the terminal and stick with bash. I've used ZSH and Fish and the learning curve just isn't worth it. I know it and for my needs bash is more than adequate. For a client I like [Tilix](https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/). I'll generally have a couple running all day and and have them set up to fade away when unfocused. They hang out there all day a keystroke away but remain unobtrusive.
